Character creation is one of those things that snags on so much stuff. I mean, everything snags on everything, it's writing. There's not a single decision that won't have consequences that you didn't predict, but without clear and well designed character everything just crumbles completely. It is its own special case.

Earlier this year I was going through everything writing to figure out what was making me lose my mind, and was ashamed to find out that what usually killed my understanding of a story was a lack of clear objective for the character. It's dumb because that's usually the first thing you learn in screenwriting classes. I solved that specific problem, but then came behavior and strategy, and it turns out there's other equally basic stuff that I've been *rawdogging*, as the kids say.

Turns out leaving things loose in my brain does *not* work for my autistic ass, so let's organize it a little bit. Here's a few questions to ask yourself when you're feeling like throwing your computer out of the window after staring at a page for 10min.

### 1: What does your character want?

The entire structure hinges on this question, because it drives the story forward. The strategies your character finds to get to their objective, and the difficulties and opposing forces that they encounter on their way, are what a story *is*. But is starts here.

**Your character wants *one* single thing.** The reader needs to know where this thing is going, there needs to be a very simple, understandable, direction. You don't have to *explain* it, spell it out. The way of making it clear is: make it *one* thing, and set them out to get it.

**This *thing* they want is also most definitely a *thing*.** A tangible thing, an object even. "They want to be happy" does not create a single driving force that compels someone to move forward. Being vague here is the easiest way to make finding out the rest of your story like pulling teeth.

If this seems too basic, make no mistake: it's a lot easier said then done. If you're like me and has a tendency to start developing a story from just *vibes* it's extremely challenging to find exactly what a character is looking for that will take them on a journey that elicits on the reader the feelings you're looking for. It comes to me in very abstract forms, first, and then I have to find a way to make "being happy" into a concrete thing to look for.

What help, if that's the case, is asking myself what represents the "happiness", or whatever vague form of the objective you have. How do you go about asking yourself things and actually managing to get answers is why most of writing actually takes place while not writing.

### 2: Why does the character want it?

Here things start getting complicated. **The reasons why someone wants something start explaining to the world who your character is, and what your story is**. They might want something because it'll save the world, or they might want something because they're a controlling asshole.

The story will dictate who much and how these reasons will show through, and what is the impact on the overall journey, but they are the core of why this person is who they are. **Not only that, but it starts the thematic discussion.** Is the story itself enabling, criticizing, or neutral about the reasons why they want the thing? Do they *get* the thing, even considering the reasons? Do they *change* the reasons why they want it over the course of their journey? 

It's fucked because there's no one way, or a rule, to go about this. It depends on what you need, what do the story needs. In Game of Thrones, Daenerys wants the throne because it's her birth right. In John Wick, John wants to kill people because the dog represented his late wife — which in turns, is a representation of his life outside of the crime world. These reasons are very intimately tied to the discussed ideas embedded deep in the story: what is the impact of your family history in how you view the world? Is it possible to completely get rid of your past?

It is *specific* to your story. This marks your character as something uniquely able to say what you want to say about life, or the world. It doesn't need to be *grand*. It just needs to be there. A story says something, whether you're trying to or not. It is a worldview, just by existing. Best be aware of it from the get go.

For me, this is usually something that comes pretty easily. Before I know who they are, I know what they're sad about, what they're lacking, what they long for. Most of my characters are extremely lonely fucks, they want whatever they want because they want to find a way to connect. But it'd be too easy if they were good at getting the things they want, wouldn't it?

### 3: How do they go about it?

We're talking about a single strategy, that may take many forms, yes, but a single one. That's a mistake often made, trying to make the character be many different things, wants many things, have different strategies. Don't be a hero. Stories are more simple than we think, no matter how complex they are—not to mention that complexity out of simplicity is a mark of great writing.

The choice of strategy is also linked to the themes of the story, and to the core of your character. **It's usually an adjective.** Are they controlling, and that's how they go about getting what they want? Are they untrusting? Are they kind?

This is also known as a ***character flaw***, because rarely we talk about characters who are *right* in how they go about things. Even things that are good can be harmful, specially when we're talking about a character who's inserted in a social context, which is... well, all of them. We're all inserted in *some* social context, whether this context is helpful or not. Sometimes our strategies hurt ourselves, or the people around us—hence this also needing to be a decision taken with the theme in mind.

This is what's currently kicking my ass. I've been having a *very* hard time honing this down from a vague idea to something clear. It's such an important thing, it's gonna define the entirety of the second act, and I can't seem to find a process to consistently design this. More often than not it ends up with me crying to my partner until she asks a good questions and suddenly everything unravels into a miraculous little nugget of truth. The unreliability of this process drives me insane.

### 4: What will hurt them so much that I can get them to do whatever I want?

Stories are usually about forcing a character to either do something they don't want to do, or to confront the opportunity they so wanted.  At some point you'll need to force your character to do things they don't want to do, or don't know how. They may or may not learn something by doing it, but you're gonna need to push them to get to that place.

This is what one of my professors used to call the ***ghost*, or the *emotional risk***. Something that haunts your character. A button to press that will break them when they can't seem to learn, or give them strength when they're about to give up. It depends on your needs, again. It's more often than not a person who your character loved beyond measure (romantically or not), or an object that represents that person. This professor used to teach this by showing us the intro to Pixar's *Up!*, in which the main character's ghost is a bottle cap, which represents his wife.

Put whatever the ghost is at risk, and you might get yourself out of some corners.

This is not exactly a story necessity, but it's a great tool in the writer toolbox that can save your ass when things don't seem to work out. I don't think I've ever used it, until now. For me the ghost is usually linked to the character motivation, as a vague thing, other than a physical object. I should explore this more, and learn how to develop my own ways to get to what a character's ghost is.

### The actual problem is mileage

As I once saw someone say, the problem is *mileage*. No matter how many times I look at things or read what they're supposed to be, I need to do them five hundred more times so my brain learns the ways to get to them without me having to *think* about it. But writing is a fucking long haul effort. It takes a long fucking time. I've been doing structure work exercises without going into actual writing of words, to see if that makes it less painful, but *jesus christ*, writing things you don't care about is boring.

As I commented on the last post, I've been trying to write more freely, but I *can't* without knowing where I'm going. There's nothing worse than being in the zone and then hitting a wall because you didn't think about that before. There's a balance between knowing a story too much, but not enough, that I'm still to learn how to achieve. I'm not sure it's possible. Woman better than me have tried and failed.

Alas, the horrors persist. But so do I.

### Cheat sheet

For the sake of my future self's sanity, and whoever else may have use for it.

- **Objective**: what does the character want? Don't be poetic. Make it a tangible thing, an object if possible. The money. The iron throne. The shark. Vengeance for their dog. What have you.

- **Why do they want it?**: now it's your time to be mushy if you want. What created this want? What's the story behind why they're willing to go to such lengths to get it? What do these reasons say about your character?

- **Behavior**: what is their strategy to get what they want? The one behavior that they always do, unconsciously, that is probably the worst way to get what they want? Are they kind? Pushy? Irresponsible? Whatever it is, keep it consistent, and give them opportunity to showcase that.

- **The Ghost**: what is the one thing (almost always, it's a person, or a thing that represents a person) that if you throw this in the game, your character will do whatever you want? What's the emotional thing or person at risk, here? You might not need this, and depending on what you usually write about, you'll never have use for it. But it's good to know. Sometimes your character needs a push.
