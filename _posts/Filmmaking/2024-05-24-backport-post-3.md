The bane of my existence is synopsis writing, or at least it has been so far, and _this ends today_. Or in what will probably be the next few days as I write this post. More realistically, the oncoming weeks.

As I recently decided to finally start tackling the holes in my knowledge of what professional writing actually entails, I found out that, as it turns out, it's a great idea to very methodically hunt and solve problems. _Who would have known_, studying works!

Before even taking a crack on perfecting the art of synopsis alone, I've been going through the previous steps of knowing what a story is truly made of. I've been going through every single thing I've learn about structure and understanding what I could do, and what I still couldn't, or didn't even understand well enough yet. Basically finding out what really stuck after formal training, and how my style of writing and the way my mind functions when I'm creating work in relationship to it. My emotionally cute/silly last post was a part of that.

Why is any of that important? Because stories without structure, whatever that structure is, are messy, feel incomplete and usually pointless or vague. Vagueness has no place in professional writing. Whatsoever. And it's very easy to be vague, but it takes a next level understanding of your own story to be both precise and concise — which is exactly what synopsis writing is about.

If I want to eventually get anything sold, let alone _made_, then I need to be able to give my writing some solid bones, and a synopsis ends up kind of being a good test to figure out if a story can stand on its legs. It needs to be short, interesting, and contain the entire story (plot, character arch, clear stakes and conflict) within more of less three short paragraphs — since I'm aiming for a Fulbright scholarship and the application process asks for 500 words maximum, I'm going to use that as a baseline.

Unless you have a good grasp on how stories work, and how _your_ stories works, specifically, even _trying_ to write one is painful and feels like wading through mud. Usually because things are missing and unclear.

And, trust me, there's nothing quite as despair-inducing as toiling over something for months or years just to be defeated by 500 words. You feel useless and like all your work was for nothing. I speak from experience. It's why it was always scary, for me: because I knew there were still things missing that I couldn't figure out.

I have a better grasp on how to solve structural problems, now, and other other holes in my knowledge will inevitably surface as I go deeper into synopsis writing for sure, but it is time to _start_.

Here's the basics, unearthed from the many resources of screenwriting classes past, so we're all in the same page going forward:

- The synopsis is **not** what's in the back of the DVD — or in the Netflix blurb, for the young'uns. That one **sells the movie for an audience**, and therefore needs to be **interesting, but not reveal much**.
    
- The professional synopsis **sells the movie to a producer**, or someone in the industry that'll help you get it sold and/or made. Even very low budget movies are expensive and take a lot of time to read and effort to make, so **you need to show them that you know what you're doing**, and that the story is interesting enough to make money back in at least some niche.
    
    - That means you gotta **demonstrate knowledge of story basic elements** and the **skill to be consistent and interesting through the entirety of it**: inciting incident, climaxes, a well constructed ending, well arc-ed character with clear motivations and objectives, a conflict that ties it all all to an overarching theme with satisfying conclusion: it's gotta be all that, in those 500 words.
        
- It also has to be well written on it's own. Because of course it has.
    

It's annoying how simple this thing actually is. It's like baking a cookie. It's just a few ingredients, but it you get just of them wrong everything goes to shit. It's a demonstration, really, a proof of concept of not just the story, but of the writer. If you can write a good synopsis chances are you can hold your own through 90 pages. Maybe not. But it's a lot more likely. For me it's like confronting everything that might go wrong all at once in a neat cute, neat, package.

So let's do it.

God fucking help me, let's do it.
