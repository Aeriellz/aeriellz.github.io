The first episode of Pluribus kinda ruined my life a little bit? I might be exaggerating, but, alas, I am not joking. I spent the last few weeks hating everything I have ever written and wanting to give up writing to get a real job somewhere doing something—*anything*—else. Vince Gilligan's shows are just not fair. I've always found his style a great example of creativity, as he's great at putting characters into situations that are completely fucking bonkers, but this time what hit me was *why* those insane situations are so important, and what they say about the nature of human connection.

A closer look at *We Is Us* is in order, then, and we'll see what this is all about while focusing on basic structure and on the one overarching decision that makes this one of the most distressing hour of media I have experienced in a long time.

> I strongly recommend you watch the episode before reading the rest of this post.

### Prepare the preparations

Your first set up often describes in great detail what the rest of a story will be. Form takes over as speech when you haven't said much, yet, and here we open on beautiful shots of the VLA, overlayed by a timer. It announces: whatever this show is about, *time* is important, in one way or another. Events develop slowly-but-surely over the course of around an year: excited astronomers go over a signal from outer space, doubtful but hopeful. Is this our own voice, bouncing around as an echo? Or is this coming from somewhere else?

*Are we fundamentally alone? Or do we belong to something greater?*

Gilligan feels no need to announce what was either a decent amount of research, a cute reference, or both. The Very Large Array in New Mexico is featured in *Contact* (1997, dir. Robert Zemeckis) for the same reason it shows up here. Radio astronomy is currently our main form of SETI—search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and if you know that you know what's happening. If not, it doesn't take long until you're clued in. A base four compound gets synthesized, distressing the half of the audience that already knows what it is and knows it's a shit idea, and the half that knows that, no matter what that shit is, a HAZMAT suit means disaster.

We've been thought a viral apocalypse, already, we *know* it's all gonna go to hell. But it hurts all the same when it does.

By the time Mr. Mouse is playing dead, the audience is primed for curiosity, tension, and earnestly stupid decisions. All of that before we even meet our main character.

Now. You don't *need* to go over all of this if you're writing the end of the world as we know it. There's half a million ways of introduce societal collapse, and most of them don't take so long, or start so far back into it. The genre is populated with fast and loose narrative, and often opts to show off its world-building as quickly as possible. Much of apocalyptical media start *in media res*, in fact, and even the ones that don't have a tendency to be expository, flashy, or downright violent in it's speed, giving the audience just enough to understand what's happening. Instead, Gilligan opts for an incremental approach that goes over *every single step of how things happen*, not because we need *information*, but because we need the *emotion*. A message is captured, and people don't know what it is. Attempts are made, and fail. Someone has an idea, and months of research toil over it. The scientists involved get to nowhere. They were so excited, but nothing is happening. When shit finally hits the fan tensions and expectations have mounted enough that this actually feels like losing something. It feels like hubris; it feels like naiveté; it feels like there was a way out, somewhere; it feels like we wanted something so much, too much, just to be met with disappointment and disaster.

The patient and piecemeal nature of the discovery is escalatory. Time means effort, and that effort is comprised of decisions that were made *actively* and *consciously*. The end of the world was never a *given*. We saw it happen, built piece by piece, one choice at a time. We were looking for connection, in the stars, and found too much of it.

This set up will guide the entirety of the first episode thematically. And, dare I say, the entirety of the show.

### Letting the character struggle

When we *do* meet Carol she is busy doing a great job pretending everything is fine. She reads to a crowd that hangs on to her every word; all of them happy and mollified by the pleasures of being diluted in an audience. While she caters to it, Carol is not a part of that world, and doesn't recognize or understand the satisfaction of belonging to that group. It is a necessary evil, unfamiliar and unwanted, and she stands opposite to it, almost cornered. When it ends, she comes out as vocally adversarial to her own role in it's existence.

From the start, she is set apart. Carol is different and under a limelight. Unique, in the worst way possible; exposed, and making sure to hide as much as she can from a world that, in this first moment, doesn't look hostile. Her wife, Helen, calls her out on it. Put out your serious book. Tell them the truth. Join, in some way. Carol refuses every opportunity of being vulnerable. There's power in that place of relative loneliness and distance; there's safety. There's also, as she soon finds out, hardship in it, too.

Circumstances beyond her understanding or choice present her with the reality that one's life doesn't always depend on one's self, and the rest of the episode focuses on the struggle of alienation by forcing her into a version of it that has no emergency exit. As Helen collapses, time is, again, of the essence. Alone, physically and emotionally, Carol must fight against the clock to save her wife's life.

It's a simple design for character objective, and endlessly effective in that simplicity: being by yourself makes everything harder, and if we had time jumps all around the first act, we barely jump around once we meet Carol. What was in the presentation of the show a reminder of the cruelly incremental nature of catastrophe is now a direct viewport into it. The narrative stops letting us float from solution to solution, and instead it confronts us with the despairing uncertainty between when a problem presents itself and the moment we find out what we can do about it. The audience is forced to watch every one of the longest few seconds of Carol's life, as she realizes no one else can help; as she looks around, helpless; as she scraps whatever resources are available; as every idea is met with more problems, more complications.

This is Gilligan's style at it's best: as the character encounters problems that are above their current ability to solve them, both writer and character are forced into a state of creativity where the way out is whatever is at hand, used in what way works, no matter how preposterous. A lot of those solutions can be found in the environment surrounding the scene, and just like that location, and every logically plausible object in it, has a full life, by being available for use. It's the reality of the human condition, and the one evolutionary advantage of an otherwise frail species, that we are a part of the world and capable of modifying it. to out advantage. A rock blocks the way, we use a tree to make stairs. Human vs. world.

That particular conflict develops and grows until it finally ends with the insurmountable loss of the one person who connected Carol to the world around her. Without Helen, Carol doesn't have an intermediary to serve as a translation and protective layer, and she is then put in a position of opening up completely or not opening up at all, since making one friend means making *every* friend. The hive-mind is an oppressive totalitarian system of existence where being outside of it means complete isolation, and being a part of it means erasure. The superposition of extremes highlights how absurd and unsustainable both of them are, and the lack of a gray scale bothers, chafes at the reasonableness of balance. 

Carol will be alone, no mater what happens, or how she choses to deal with it, and she has all the time in the world to think about her seclusion. Her struggle has only just begun.

### Conclusion: the power of patience

At it's core, Pluribus seems to ask the same questions the Fermi Paradox does: if I'm here, and it stands to reason that there must be others, why am I still so lonely? Is it safer this way, or just sadder?

Being lonely is all about *time*. Loneliness stretches your hours, warps your sense of self, makes everything a thankless grind. If you're lucky enough to have a goal, it makes it joyless. It you don't, that's depression. At the structural core of Vince Gilligan's creativity and style for *We Is Us* is a profound respect and understanding of struggle and it's correlation to time. Tension is a weapon pointed at the extremes that create it, the snap of its breaking echoing the contradictions and conflicts inherent to the matter.

Carol's isolation is introduced by first prefacing it with loneliness as a universal matter, implying that while her case is special, and the one discussed, it is a larger debate that has no easy solution as simple as *yes* or *no*. Ahead is, no doubt, a show that arguments on all sides of the matter, and I can't wait to understand Carol better and see how her history informs her decisions; her grievances with the hive-mind, as well as her eventual compromises to it. All of those judgments will be made one by one, creating a path towards a final answer that is riddled with mistakes and bad calls, and while the audience doesn't have to agree with them it does have to *understand* it. By crafting a story that lets the characters struggle, the writers drop the viewer straight into the stretch of time, and allow the story to fill the spaces in it, forcing the audience to confront the reality of their own choices when faced with those same issues. Being there, you can't escape the silent violence of uncertainty, or the anxiety of fear.

There will always be value in the exposition of trauma, in writing, but just like a montage of hard work is always going to make it seem easy, skipping pain often makes it fell unwarranted. Nothing will ever substitute direct experience when it comes to generating empathy—or, at the very least, *sympathy*—, and distressing your audience with true consequence takes discipline. You can't, as the designer of this journey, just jump head to the good part.

It's deceptively simple, but punishingly hard to attain, as a writer. *We Is Us* is a masterclass in patience, intentional design and control. Nothing is left to chance, nothing is there by accident, and nothing that asks for you attention will jerk you around with it. Very few things happen, but they're all important. It takes a brave writer's room, a confident showrunner, and it's probably to bothering a lot of people—just like it should.

### Addendum

This kind of series reminds me of something I heard once, about how an audience is smarter than you, even if they're fucking dumb. Truth is, it's not up to you to decide if they're understanding what you mean or not. It's none of your business.

A friend has said of *Pluribus* that she was glad to finally watch a show that doesn't treat her like she's stupid. It presumes you're smart and worldly enough to get where it's going, but it doesn't matter if you're not. Understanding makes you anxious. Ignorance makes you curious. That's the assumption. It's a win-win, for a script standpoint, too. You're feeling *something*, and any of those feelings grant the writing an in into your emotional comprehension of the story. If the show interested you in any way to start with, the writing *will* hit, in one way or another.

Presuming competence, while not punishing the lack of it, is a form of respect to those who are listening to you as you tell them a story. They are allowed to ask questions, to engage freely, to be challenged, and not looked down to. Your job is never to make those decisions for someone else. I think fiction has been forgetting that, as of late, to respect those who watch it, even if general audiences have been particularly difficult for a while now. It's been a weird time for tv writing, sure, but I think it's high time we all stop catering to the worse of ourselves, audiences and creators alike. I thank Gilligan and team for not diving down that particular pitfall.
