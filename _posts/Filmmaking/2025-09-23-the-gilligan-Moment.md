What the hell, you ask, is a Gilligan Moment?

All in due time. First, a bit of film history: the name comes by example of the *Lubistch Touch*, which, named after [Ernest Lubitsch](https://harvardfilmarchive.org/programs/that-certain-feeling-the-touch-of-ernst-lubitsch), a writer and director from Hollywood's Golden Age, speaks of his hard-to-describe, but unique filmmaking style. His movies are fun, sexy, witty, and classy; full of quick exchanges without being theatrical, and delightfully non-obvious.

His style represents a lot of what filmmaking has *lost* in the last twenty odd years. The art of not being boring. Most of everything I watch nowadays ends up with uninspired turns of plot, bland moments, and a reverence to logic that ruins the fun for excess of *making sense*. I'm not sure if audiences have lost their imagination and capacity for suspension of disbelief, but as Hollywood falls more and more into the trap of comfort, people seem to accept it wholeheartedly.

*Well, not this girl, she won't.*

*Gilligan Moment* is the name I give for all that is contrary to the apathy and overseriousness of contemporary cinema. These are moments that made me believe there's still a shred of creativity in this world and that not everything is gray and stale. It's named after Vince Gilligan, of Breaking Bad fame, who that started his career writing for X-Files, and is responsible for some of the best moments of that show. He's one of the most original writers out there who's still working, who manages to pull novelty out of thin air, use it dramatically, and elevate it it to commentary in memorable and exciting ways.

It all starts with the moment that inspired the creation of this moniker—Tio Hector and his bell, from Breaking Bad's *Grilled* (season 2, episode 2), but goes on to become a celebration of creativity, joy, and fun. It's about taking filmmaking in the spirit of *play*, and about letting art extend real life and not just be a comment on it. These are also great examples of showing instead of telling, and how to do it masterfully.

The list is forever in construction, and encompasses both film and television. It tries to not spoil the moment itself, and I have included the name of the writer responsible for the episode.
