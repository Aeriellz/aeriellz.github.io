I wrote 13 versions of the synopsis of the movie for the Fulbright grant attempt this year, and I named them so I could keep track of the changes, and what was happening.

Before I talk about the entire journey — I've submitted the thing a couple days ago — I would like to share the names of each version. They're very telling. You can see the exact point where I started to just... _fucking lose it_.

I talked about [what a synopsis is](https://aeriellz.github.io/filmmaking/2024/05/24/backport-post-3.html), technically, and what the first steps and iterations had been. It's easy to track the things I talked about on my last post — how it was all a game of chicken against my own mind, and not so much about being a good writer. But it _does_ become about knowing what you're doing at some point. You read a lot, and you write a few versions, and you start understanding —, and _oh, this is character motivation and I need it very clear from the start_ or _my character's behavior is not clear, so it's like they have no agency_.

You write a base and then it's all troubleshooting from there. Does this feel like a movie? Does this feel like a _good_ movie? It also becomes more and more about being good with words. A screenwriter once told me that no matter how many pages or words you have available, it never feels like enough, and that is a _profound_ truth, but five hundred words is just about the minimum you need to squeeze everything in there. Who's the character, what do they want, why, what are the obstacles, how they deal with it, what do they win or lose. You can do it easy enough if you're mechanical about it, but then it's just... really so boring. I found that out around version 6.

Also, the movie just... wasn't there, yet. I had a bunch of stuff happening, but the character was just going through it, just taking it in, instead of shaping the story themselves.

Between the first time I stopped to get some distance from the story, around version 8, and the last one, things changed _drastically_. The story became itself only around version 11. You fix one thing and suddenly you have five hundred other problems, and then you fix those, and it opens into more. Not to mention that writing the same thing over and over again starts eroding the very fabric of your sanity. You either bring someone else in or you _will_ start throwing things at people — version 8, where my lovely partner came in to give me some perspective.

This was probably the worst part, because it felt like the story was never gonna come together. For the longest time I was hopping between the micro and the macro view so wouldn't break down into a mess of plot holes, and trying to keep track of everything. It's a bit despair inducing, but it somehow did start to make sense, and started to come together.

Finishing version 11, I finally saw the story I had in my head take the shape of a _movie_. That was the moment when I understood what a movie truly was. _Oh, this is what makes a movie a movie, not a tv show, not a book._

I truly never learned so much as I have about story then I have trying to get this thing done. And not in the sense of knowing how to write, but understanding what things actually need to _be_. At some point it just clicked, and I was suddenly ashamed of literally everything I have ever written until this point in my life.

It barely looked like I spent an entire year working on this one 500 word document. The important bits are there, tidily tied together by cause and consequence. The main character is profoundly simple, flawed, but also human, complex in its motivations. The story is easy to follow, but also full of life. Every detail comes together, nothing is left to chance.

It was glorious. Amazing. Loved every second. Never felt more fulfilled, more talented. And more obviously conscious of all my flaws as a writer. But we'll talk about that next time.
