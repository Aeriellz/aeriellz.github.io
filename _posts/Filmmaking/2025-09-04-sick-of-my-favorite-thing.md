Writing is one of the things I've been doing ever since I was pretty much a kid, it was always a source of joy and a good way to pass the time. I loved it so much that I decided I would learn more of it, and so I went to school for filmmaking and my last ten years have been about storytelling, story structure, story this, story that. Now, the problem with dedicating a decade to something you love profoundly is that you star to not *like* it very much.

I still *love* writing, but especially when it comes to fiction I'm more than a little bit sick of it. This one activity was the pivot around which my entire 20s have revolved. It was great! And completely exhausting of my ability to engage with stories. I can't watch movies or TV shows anymore; I can't read anything fictional; whenever someone tells me what's happened to them last night I start thinking about midpoints, inciting incidents, thematic coherence.

It's not very conducive to good times. I'm going a bit nuts. Not to mention it's done a lot of damage to my ability to write freely, to make mistakes and not think about what *should* happen. Is this sentence too long? Too short? Am I varying my sentence structure enough that this paragraph doesn't feel boring and repetitive? Did I write the world *sentence* too many times and now people are gonna think I'm pretending I ever studied formally?

It starts getting obsessive. The end result of too much instruction is self-doubt. At some point you have to commit yourself to not giving a shit. Making mistakes and experimenting things without worrying about results is the only way out of a rut like this. Or at least I think so. I'm not sure it's gonna work, but I sure as hell hope so because I *miss* liking the things I like.

I guess it's time to just write freely. No structures. No format. Just fun with words.
