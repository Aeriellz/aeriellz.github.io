So. I'm getting my license to drive a bike, and I suck at it. I fell down a bunch of times, broke a piece of the bike on day two and failed to finish the practice circuit so many times that the frustration got to me. I woke up early one day and was so dreading the whole thing it that I went to the driver's school and asked to stop. There were just three classes left before the final test, but it was too much. Time to accept reality and give up. By sheer luck my instructor was there and changed my mind. 

What does any of this have to do with writing? Well, it has to do with the fact that sometimes we need distance from things.

Because the schedule of classes is usually designed to bunch up all classes for each student as close as possible, by the time I managed to sit down with the secretary to reschedule my last classes the whole next two weeks were all taken up by other people. They managed to slip me in, but I'd have to wait at least 16 days for my next one. It felt like a waste of time until the day arrived to be on top of a bike again and I something simple and vital hit me like a truck: *I wasn't scared anymore*. Enough time had passed, enough things had happened, in the meantime, that I forgot I was afraid. The frustration over my mistakes was gone, because I hadn't made any in a while, I didn't know where my usual points of failure were anymore. The expectation to fail again was there, but subdued, easily handled.

By giving myself enough time and distance from the subject I had regained my own confidence to learn, and so much made sense, then. 

We often hear about *giving it time*, but where we sometimes perceive that as using that time to try again and again, often what we need is to leave it the fuck alone. Not do it, not be around it, go be somewhere else. *We need to forget.* 

So much around us emphasizes speed, being quick to learn, quick to do it, quick to jump to the next thing, get the result, get the final product, perform—as if time was the enemy. As if the experience was somehow detached from the thing it generates. As if our proudest achievements aren't often void of monetary value, while filled with the memories and meaning to us and ours.

My therapist heard me complain about how bad I felt for not sitting down to write more an _immeasurable_ amount of time, both of us trying to figure out the key to productivity before her, in a moment of wisdom that I think had little to do with her degree and more with the fact that she was 30 years my senior, finally read me, realized what this was all about and said:

***"You need to expand your definition of what writing means."***

Back then that meant including research, outlining, organizing, not just a number of pages filled. As time has passed, I've learned to include even more in this definition. 

Forgetting is not a bug of the human condition, it is a *feature* of leaning and creating, and of *being happy*. It's how our mind gets rid of things that don't matter and finds space for the things that do. More than that, it's how we get rid of what is actively harming us and hindering our process. We're all fixated on *solving*, doing, excavating issues to the bone, even when it stops helping, but to forget we need to stop poking at it. We need to let it be and go do something else.

And there's no telling how much time it'll take. There's no making it quicker. There's only letting it do it's thing. A friend of mine once said: nine women cannot birth a child in a month, and that stuck to me so much.

Things take time. Why are we so afraid of that?

It doesn't mean we're to stop putting the work and sitting down and getting to it, but it does mean that sometimes writing looks like not writing at all and letting ourselves do something else that has absolutely nothing to do with it.

I've spent years turning things around in my head and worrying about this and that for days and thinking that this worry was somehow productive, and that's is a fantastic feat of self delusion, when you think about it. It only ever worked in my own detriment. You either sit the fuck down and do the work that is there to be done, or you let it be. Inspiration won't come forced, so turning things over until it becomes painful borders on self harm.

It doesn't mean you need the *muses* to tell you what to do, either. You need to spend time with the thing, work on your relationship with it, develop it when it's working, and ask questions when it's not. It won't always answer you right away. And when it doesn't you need to leave it alone for a while so you can stop teaching your mind that looking at something you started out of love means anxiety and failure.

There's a balance to it. A rhythm, like a song. A flurry of activity and excitement followed by a calmer, more contemplative section. They trade and intertwine, and the music it creates has it's own run time.

I'm not saying this is easy, specially if you're a type A kinda person. We tend to think that the only way to get things done is to be there and get at it and be present in every single second of it to make sure the results are gonna be satisfactory and that the process is not gonna stop. Now, this is about writing, but it's also about life: rigidity is the easiest way to break a system. The more you control it the less it works. Things will stop. Things will be delayed. Challenges should be enjoyed, too, and that won't happen if you have a time limit to figure it out.

We have time limits for so much. Why add it to this, too?

I used to hate the fact that I took so long to write, that everything I've ever created took so long, and often left me so frustrated with how long it took I stopped doing it altogether. I think I'm developing a better relationship to it, now; acquiring respect, a fondness, for the clock, instead of a fear of it. My perfectionism isn't as much of a problem when I give it space and time to work, for example. Instead of just curbing so I can reach the end, I let it fly, so I can reach satisfaction.

In a way, writing—art, *creation*—is a leap of faith. There's thing you can chose, and there's things that seemingly happen on their own. For those, we walk through time, changing it, and we let time walk through us, changing us. So write slowly. Paint slowly. Forget. Remember only what you need.
