I'm stealing this sentence from Sorkin because it describes too well the kinda of thing I've been dealing with when it comes to writing: it's been that kinda of day, when you have a problem and you don't even understand it very well, let alone how to solve it. It led me to steal something else: a dude on YouTube's idea to write mini-essays everyday so I can at least try to explain to myself how this is going.

Let's get down to the issue, then: I'm writing a movie and the structure doesn't seem to wanna be structured. It's annoying. I understand there's a lot of people out there who absolutely hate the "writing rules" and "following structure" but I don't know what to tell you, I'm not one of them. I'm not here to reinvent the wheel. I just wanna write a fun thing, and taking a look at how Hollywood and commercial filmmaking does it helps. It specially helps because stories have sort of a rhythm to them. Big things are followed by not-so-big things, and then you get carried by the cadence of it. Stories breathe. And structures help me make sure that it's breathing _right_; [that the story it's not suffering from tachycardia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38Cy_Qlh7VM), or not going anywhere.

For me, that means getting key moments their due weight: inciting incidents, midpoints, climaxes. Even if you're writing revolutionary art house stuff, these are things that your story is gonna end up having, one way or another. Right now I have the scenes, but I don't know what they _mean_ in the story. How important they are for the character, and the arc.

Is this point in the story the inciting incident? Is it actually the break to act 2? Can it possibly be both at the same time? What does the break to act 2 mean, again?

I'm back to the notes and books from my first screenwriting classes, and realizing that I have a lot more holes in my understanding of storytelling than I thought I had. They're a little bigger than expected. And maybe my stories are way too ambitious? Or maybe they don't fit basic structures easily, which... fair—I never said structures weren't limited: they are, by design.

Current I have a character with a problem, and another character that offers a solution in exchange for a service. But which one of these is the character's true objective? The one that's gonna carry the movie further? Which one of these carry the fundamental question of that makes the movie work?

Or maybe it's a problem regarding the order the information about the problem and the service are presented.

You wanna know what's _more_ annoying than all of this? Not being able to actually _write_ what the problem truly is. I wish writing wasn't so shrouded in secrecy, that as a writer we could feel more open to spell things out.

Before that happens, it's vague blogging about it, I guess. Which helps, but not as much as it could.
