People don't walk around announcing their feelings. Most people don't even *think* clearly about what they're feeling. They just feel it, and act accordingly. When they *do* have to speak, they are not trying to get an A in therapy. They want to be *right*, they want to defend themselves, or they want to help. Moments of self-awareness are not that common. Even when we know what the problem is, we don't always know how to fix them.
