One of the saddest things about editing videos for companies is that more often than not you are contractually bound to pretty much not exist in the process. Unlike editing for fiction, in advertising the crew rarely—if ever—ends up with their names in the credits somewhere. When have you ever seen credits in ads?

Not that I'm a big name in editing advertisement, god forbid. I wish. But *god forbid*. But yeah, I wish. I mean, the money would be nice, sure, but more so the level of challenge and production you can be close to. Even something as simple as Instagram reels can have interesting development, and exciting versions, so I imagine bigger stuff has an unhinged, exhausting, but interesting production stories. Will it take a few years off your life expectancy? Sure. But some people smoke cigarettes. We all have our self-destructive habits.

Video editing, in general, is an interesting job. You are given very little, asked for a lot; you will operate some miracles at times, fumble the ball at others, and the best case scenario is that most people will never notice you've been there at all. Your filmmaking-school-trained good taste takes doesn't just the back seat, it is locked in the trunk, bound and gagged, trying to scream at you through a dirty cloth, telling you to quit tomorrow because this is bullshit and these people are fucking insane. Who? Whoever is asking you just to *just extend the shot with AI and put whatever feel good vibes music you find first on Pandemic Sound*.

Suffice to say, most of the published videos I've worked on aren't even the versions I *like*. It doesn't really bother me, but it *is* sad that no one will see how things came to be. Simple shit still teaches me all the time. And yeah, I can use the published videos and say *hey, I made this, isn't it cool?* sure, but that's not how I like to do things. Process is important to me, the things that taught me are important to me. I'm a creature of learning. Just calling things done and being happy about it doesn't cross my mind unless I'm on the verge of a meltdown.

Does corporate get me really close to it, at times? Absolutely. Who amongst us has not taken five minutes to cry on company time in the office bathroom? It is a staple of being neurospicy in the workforce. This life was not made for us. And still, we find a way to have fun and take something out of it, other than just a paycheck. Working to survive is a sad thing, even if we've all been there. There has to be something else. Eight hours a day, forty hours a week. That's a *lot* of my life you're asking for. Letting me use what I've done for education purposes and bragging rights is the *least* companies can do, but corporate often treats the *least* not as a floor, but a ceiling.

It's the price of doing business, sure, and we all gotta pay it. And I do mean *all* of us. I found the HR big boss crying in the middle stall once.
