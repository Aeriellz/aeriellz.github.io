*Jurassic World: Dominion* was immediately a *hell no* for me when it came out some time ago.

I'm a lover of junkfood cinema and I'm always checking the newest blockbuster for cheap thrills, but everything has a limit. Not for snotty reasons — I'm not *that* kind of movie snob. I just happened to have profoundly enjoyed *Jurassic World*, which meant that watching the sequels was a horrible idea. Nothing good comes out of a *Jurassic* sequel. The childlike wonder I felt seeing the opened park was too precious to be ruined so casually, so I decided it was never gonna happen.

Until I hit a bad week. My brain was mush and I was so exhausted I couldn't think straight, so, for reasons that go beyond logic, I have decided to finally watch *Jurassic World: Dominion*, last week. Surprisingly enough, I had a blast. Or maybe not that surprisingly. My expectations where so profoundly low given how horribly handled *Fallen Kingdom* had been, that it would have been on the wrong side of impressive for me to hate it.

The story is not disastrous, and the preachiness is actually kinda charming given the world we leave in. All in all it's a very *didactic* movie that speaks to my inner child, that small part of me that wants to believe that even when it comes to complex matters, things are simple: corporate should not be allowed anywhere near genetics. Beyond that, the hints at what the world became with the additions of predators that can and *will* hunt us are delicious world building. The poaches and the black markets, specially, tickled something in my brain. Owen and Claire are an adorably clumsy with that teen of a child, and my old scientists, Grant and Sattler, steal the show by just being there. 

Now, the superposition of those two sets of characters made me think about the Jurassic movies and why they work or don't, as storytelling. This is where it *does* become my kind of snob, so be warned. Storytelling nerdery ahead.

The way I see it two *Jurassic* movies work extremely well: *Jurassic Park* and *Jurassic World*, with *Dominion* finding a spot in the "it's almost what I wanted it to be" category.

### Jurassic Park (1993, dir. Steven Spielberg)

This movie is a classic for good reason. It's Spielberg, so some of the most creative filmmaking you'll see in your life. Truly, they don't make them like this, anymore. Suspense is masterfully created, and the tension is held by great use of camera placement and withholding of information. Much money is spend in showing up the *T. rex*, but it's the puddles of water that announce just how scared you should be of them. Scale is communicated by what it *means*. Big things don't translate well on screen automatically; it doesn't really matter how gigantic something is if it's not affecting the space around it.

But all that is for the directing team. The reasons why they can do all that is the story choices that put solid ground beneath their creative feet.

First of all we have a very classic and simple character arch, with Grant learning how to care for the kids. It's less about awakening a parental streak in him then it is about yanking this man out of the isolation of academia and connecting him back to the rest of the human race. It's the best possible use of a dinosaur scenario, really. These characters are all *prey*. It's a survival game, and the one thing we have going against monsters evolved to kill is community. Taking care of your young is an animal instinct, which pairs well with the themes in the movie. It ties the entire story together well, giving you a reason to care about it.

While many writers have a penchant for developing *from* character, I think Hollywood teaches us that you can start with a high concept and find equally satisfying stories by working backwards and asking ourselves what would this teach someone. It's solid ground, and from there the characters and their arcs are supported by the true jewel of the series: the world building.

You have an unopened theme park where dinosaurs roam. There's closed off rides, colorful vehicles, systems, personnel, remote stations, lingo, science. This would *explode* with possibility in the heads of the most dead-inside person on this planet. It fills this universe with not just this one story, but the ghosts of countless other possible stories.

The hints at how complex this place is, and how it works, make it exciting, but the fact that the narrative *uses* those complexities, make it *real*. Every detail has a real consequence that affects the choices of the characters and how well they navigate the challenges posed to them. It's not just pretty window dressing. The interactions between character and environment are adversarial to the point where the environment itself becomes an antagonistic force. From entire buildings to the pots and pans—everything is real, because everything is consequential.

### Jurassic World (2015, dir. Colin Trevorrow)

Ah, *J. World*, my beloved. This movie is a great example of how to reboot your universe. You see the park opened. You ask yourself *why the fuck would anyone do this*. The filmmakers won. You in it. It's close enough to the setting of the first one to be familiar to anyone who watched it, and different enough to be novel. You have a ~~autistic nerd~~ character with a very strong interest in the park and social difficulties, two kids, and an environment trying to kill them all. Enough hubris to overflow olympic pools. Don't you love a character who's profoundly wrong?

I find it interesting how the movie starts with divorcing parents and the kids getting into the car. The drop-off at the airport is understated, but competent in it's writing, almost a silent announcement of *I know what I'm doing*. It worries about the heart of the story first, and then wows you later, with the glass ride into the park.

Claire doesn't have as clear of an arc as Grant, but in many ways it is more delicious for it's non-obviousness. She's going to care about the kids anyway, she's family, even if she's a workaholic, but that's not the end goal, that's the first stop. No, Claire's arc is much more interesting, much more related to the very glass-and-steel walls of this place. She starts out as this well-put-together creature of constructed beauty and ends up disheveled, undone, *real*. *Jurassic World* returns Claire to a primal state of being, of raw humanity, that strips her of over-civility just enough to remind her that she is an *animal*.

In a world that tries to make everything sleek and flawless, this movie does the opposite and brings you close to earth, grass, dirt, fear and wonder—not to revolt, but to comfort. Owen is in tune with his... well, *natural* nature, to the point of being able to coexist with the very things that try to kill him. He is not less civilized for doing it, even if Claire wants to think of him that way. She's the one who needs to change, to adapt to this new reality. The technology, the knowledge, the numbers—all that our species has created to control a primal universe is not enough to keep it at bay. Because it *is* us, too. 

And again, we make great use of environment, with the central themes embedded in the design and the use of structures. The park and all it's security and advancement is not enough to contain such power, breaking down at every collision to the forces that oppose it. In every interaction this polished façade breaks down. The park becomes the danger. When it comes to it, the military solutions are cruel, unnecessarily destructive and ineffective. The famed shot of Claire, clothes torn and hair messy, lighting the flare and running from the *Indominus rex*, is a powerful symbol of the alloy she was always meant to become, and of the ultimate solution to the confrontation between a natural world and a constructed one: woman who's capable of facing unruly, ancestral, forces to guide it to where it needs to be. All of that while wearing a pair of heels.

### Jurassic World: Dominion (2022, dir. Colin Trevorrow)

If the first series is about survival, the second series is about coexistence. You have been reminded that you are a creature of flesh and blood; delicate, in spite of how you managed to rule the world you live in. Your own inner world is a lot more unruly than your sophisticated shell suggests.

What now?

Well, *Dominion* does a good job of mixing and matching the strengths and insufficiencies of the human species. Again, there's the abuse of power over creatures less fortunate than us and over an environment that is too complex for our dainty squishy brains to understand, and the fact that we're very, *very*, thin skinned animals. The themes of hubris and misuse of technology are even more prominent and obvious, brought to surface so harshly, actually, that the story feels preachy and clumsy. But it *does* work, in a way. It communicates what it needs to, even if a bit artlessly. Good for kids, even if I do think kids are smarter than that. But yeah, I would have gone insane for this at the age of 12, to be honest. Sometimes it's nice to hear it spelled out like that. It has an effect of reminding you that no, you're not insane. The world *is* kinda going downhill and there *are* some sane people out there ready to admit it.

The movie is also a lot less... *personal* than the two other functioning movies in the franchise. There's no discernible character arc for any of our mains, even we if have a competently designed story, two intertwining plots with clear beginning and end: Claire and Owen look for their child, while Settler and Grant try to save the world from an ecological disaster.

This lack of a character leading the audience by their emotions is, I think, the major risk this movie takes unnecessarily. Specially because it fails kinda miserably. It's a great device if you're going for a more artsy narratives where the themes in the story rise to the forefront of the whole thing. In a sort of Brechtian-esque thing it would work incredibly well. You just let the Horrors™ talk. But the story design around the themes can't do the heavy lifting if your characters are going to just declare the point of the whole thing every five seconds.

In all honestly, I have no clue why Emily Carmichael is the writer, here. She's an art house writer; talented, but maybe not super suited for a blockbuster. Not with Trevorrow directing, at least, who knows. The base story-line for this instalment is a lot more understated and nuanced than the action-packed *J. World*. Where a survival tale goes well with extravagant SFX, this one is less "let's run away from this thing" and more "what have we done?". It's not about the kind of spectacle treatment Trevorrow is good at, it's about discussion. The mix is dangerous, and doesn't do justice to any of the forms of filmmaking involved, in this case. It just feels like a movie that says a lot, gets nowhere, and packs no punch. If you're not expecting—or used to—looser stories, it's probably even worse.

But where this movie makes me feel like shaking the above-line crew is the use it makes of the world-building—of lack thereof. We're presented a rich world of consequences that is so goddamn juice, so delicious. The poachers sequence with Owen is just fun and *novel*. It's expected that we'd have people using the animals for horrid reasons, but them being breed in captivity as exotic pets, poached for bone and other resources — *God* that is *consequence.* That is *real* and non-obvious. Christ, what in the *world* are people doing with these poor beasts? There's a host of illegalities that are alluded to, governmental problems, and also the fact that the dinos are literally just killing people right and left. How do we marry those things? How does *life find a way out of this*?

Well... the movie never tells you. The dangers and contradictions of this world are never further discussed, or even alluded to. It makes sense that we use half of the cast to work on the ethics of genetic manipulation, but the other half of the story—the part that *gives it a name* is all but ignored. The Maisie Lockwood plot is, again, all about the science. The best we get on the dinos is a sequence in the black market where the movie turn into a spy movie and becomes a fraction of what it should always have been: meaningful action carried out by interesting characters, in a universe that is specifically designed to press on the sore spots of their flaws.

In an ideal world, Kayla Watts (portrayed by DeWanda Wise) would take her spot as protagonist and lead the movie into a genuinely fun debate of animal rights.

Unfortunately, Hollywood is not that brave. Or too blind. Or both. Who's to say.

All that being said, I had a lot of fun. Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Neill carry their section of the movie so well, so convincingly, and so lightly that I just had a blast. The tension is silly and fun, their part of the narrative actually makes sense, and, let's be honest, nothing beats a lifetime of acting. Ellie Sattler announcing her divorce is the single most compelling moment in the entire runtime, making me care more about her and Grant than I have ever cared about Maisie being kidnapped by evil geneticists.

### Conclusion

All in all, it's... almost there? Kinda? There's good material in here, but it's mishandled by virtue of having it's priorities in weird places, I think. The features that allow a movie like this to work are there, only half hidden, as if the movie wanted to be something else, but couldn't deviate too much from where it came for.

In my opinion they should've committed to a classic three act, but I get it. Hollywood has a difficult task in the 2020s. It's usual format doesn't comfortably allow for grand complexities, but audiences are not impressed by the blockbuster form anymore. Television and streaming allow for enough time to tell a story with clear stakes, but developed nuance, and this is what a whole generation of film goers has learned is "good". Two hours—or three, even—, is just not enough anymore, and empty spectacle is just as disappointing. How does one reinvent an industry 100 years old, then? If you can answer that question, someone will most definitely show up at your door tomorrow with a few million dollars.
