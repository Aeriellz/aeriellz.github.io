The reason I've been an unhappy writer as of late has been found, and I'm ashamed to say that it's because of something simple, deadly, and embarrassing. I have been taking myself too seriously.

It's a known mistake for me. Less about thinking I'm gonna write the next palm d'or, and more about wanting things to be good, to my own unrealistic standards. Really just *expecting* myself to solve all problems and push myself beyond my current limit, and wanting too hard for things to *mean* something. It's less about external validation and more about wanting my *own* validation. A glorious arrival at some mythical, magical, peak; an excellence that is undefined and, therefore, impossible. And more than that: the need for all of this to happen yesterday.

My own expectations toward myself are my worst enemy, have always been. I know that, and time and time again, I find myself stuck and annoyed at something I love without knowing why, unaware that this is, again, the problem behind it all. I've recently found out the very real and diagnosable reason why, but it's still not easy dealing with the consequences of it, or recognize when it's happening.

This time I finally bumped into the answer while writing with a friend. We've been both out of means and ways to shoot films or write something that's not for corporate use, or instagram, or both, and we decided it was time to get together and make something just to make it. Just to put our degrees to something that didn't feel entirely depressing.

We have some rules. Whatever we make needs to have a beginning and an end, be possible with whatever money we have in our pockets and already owned equipment, and be a one weekend shoot. It should also never exceed 10min of runtime, no matter what. The most important rule, though, was that the entire thing would serve more as a directing exercise than anything else. My friend is more of a director, while I'm more of a writer, so this took the pressure completely away from the script.

I didn't even realize how easy it was to work with a dumb and short concept until we were laughing and trading ideas. Nothing had to *mean* anything. Nothing had to say anything. We barely had a character. It felt fun, and light, and the it all flowed so well out of us it was no time at all until we had two pages of nonsense that wasn't nonsense at all, and were ready to start thinking on how to get it done.

I felt good writing, truly good, and confident about what I could achieve. I haven't felt like this in years. I had *fun*, when I barely remembered what this was like.

It's good to find out that it's something I'm capable of feeling again, but at the same time it saddens me because the expectations problem is not something I know how to avoid. I haven't found ways to sidestep it, to work with my own brain and emotions so that they'll leave me the fuck alone. There is a way, because there's always a way. But I haven't found it yet, and it's frustrating, and worrying, in a way.

Writing—creative work in general—is as much about your mental state as it is about raw skill. Being able to bring joy back, or just never lose it, is something I truly need at this point. It's what will keep me trying, learning, failing. The external validation is nice, but not strictly necessary to me. But joy... that one *is*.

No despair, though. Awareness is a step. I'll figure it out. Slowly but surely.
