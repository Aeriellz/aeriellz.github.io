I got rejected by the Fulbright commission for a screenwriting scholarship twice. Once because my writing was really bad, and the other because... well, I don't know, actually, they never told me. Maybe the same reason, who knows. The first time it hurt a lot, because rejection was still a sore spot for me. The second was an extreme relief, for reasons I've [previously mentioned](https://aeriellz.github.io/filmmaking/2025/09/04/sick-of-my-favorite-thing.html).

I'm happy it didn't work out, because now it means I can finally be free. It's just that I have no idea what it *means* to be free. There's so many constraints you have to be under when you're writing to fit a certain expectation, or to check some boxes and it's weird not being held to those. Constraints to creativity can feel like training wheels. They help if you know how to behave around them. I've learned that, I can do it, and I've happily subscribed to most of those constraints in my journey so far. I'm very grateful for what they taught me.

Even so, I knew I didn't want to try Fulbright again, and that decision had, then, a lot to do with the exhaustion of the whole process. Emotional, more than anything else. There's a lot of paperwork that need to be done, a lot of proofs and academic documents, a lot of *money*, too. It's not something you can do without putting effort into it, and what hit me the most was always the self-imposed pressure to be perfect. To cater to what they want in order to appease, to become the perfect student in order to prove I'm worthy. They want a certain thing, a certain kind of writing, and it's their prerogative. But am I that person? Clearly, I am not. And I've let go, since, of the need to become it. To use those restraints, and be comfortable in them. What I have found since then is a lot of confusion.

Truth be told, freedom is difficult. Option is difficult. There's a full spectrum of things to choose from, and there's this ever-present illusion that within those choices a perfect one will materialize to solve all your problems. There's too much that's possible, and it's hard to make something that makes sense within the chaos. That has always been the struggle of art, and if the restraints helped me cut down on those choices, now I have to learn to cut them down on my own. But what criteria will I use? Using limitations as a tool helped me with this one, and I've learned that *taste* is the your first and most important filter. It's just that trusting your own taste when you're a recovering people-pleaser is easier said than done.

My tastes feel incongruent with the current scenario for stories, right now; it's scary, even knowing no one knows what truly will hit an audience and work. You have to be a little delusional, trust that your creation has value even though there's no one there to prove it to you—or not care at all if it has. There's a lot of therapy that has to go into something like this for it to be possible at all, and I'm not sure I've had enough just yet. When problems invariably come up, when I hit wall after wall, the first thing I ask myself is *is this worth it?*

Not that I know how to do anything else. If I'm not writing, or involved in it, then there's very little in my arsenal that I can actually use to even be part of this world. I remember reading some article on Medium the designer of Secret Hitler wrote while making the game, saying that it's not like you don't have a choice. You absolutely do. You can either do it or kill yourself.

That's kinda how it feels like doing something unhinged like "writing" in a world where chatGPT is a thing. It's when I start wondering why I didn't become a lawyer like my original plan was. I would never, but I do wish sometimes. The illusion that it'd be easier is somehow comforting. At the very least I'd be making money.

Right now I'm writing this instead of working on the movie I starts ages ago, or the book I promised myself I'd finish. Mostly because I'm scared of them. My last few sessions of complete freedom while writing were met with questions, problems, doubts, uncertainty, and I haven't found a way to deal with those yet. I went back to outlining and it helped a bit, but then it didn't, anymore, and I'm not sure what to do. So I'm [taking my own advice](https://aeriellz.github.io/filmmaking/2025/10/04/an-ode-to-slow-writing.html) and doing nothing, for a little bit. It'll either make me more anxious or distance me from the fear. I'm hoping right now it'll be the second.
