I got rejected by the Fulbright commision for a screenwriting scholarship twice. Once because my writing was really bad, and the other because... well, I don't know, actually, they never told me. Maybe the same reason, who knows. The first time it hurt a lot, because rejection was still a sore spot for me. The second was an extreme relief, for reasons I've [previously mentioned](https://aeriellz.github.io/filmmaking/2025/09/04/sick-of-my-favorite-thing.html).

I'm happy it didn't work out, because now it means I can finally be free. It's just that I have no idea what it *means* to be free.Â 

There's so many constraints you have to be under when you're writing to fit a certain expectation, or to check some boxes and it's so weird not being held to those.
