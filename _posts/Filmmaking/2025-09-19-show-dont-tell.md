I don't care if you're writing a script, a novel, fanfiction, a comic book, *non-fiction*, it doesn't matter. The only thing exempt from this might be poetry. If it has a story in it, *for the love of god*, let moments speak for themselves.

That's what "show, don't tell" means, but there's a change no one has ever explained to you what this truly means, judging by the state of recent literature, so let's go over some important things about it. 

1. **Behavior is golden.**  Actions are all you need. When in doubt, cut all narration and feelings explanation. Just tell me what they're doing. Is she nervous? Don't write that. Write that she's picking on her fingers. No matter what someone is thinking, or feeling, it *shows* in how they *behave*.

2. **Resist the urge to explain the audience what you mean.** The power of a scene lies in letting the audience figure things out for themselves. They might not get exactly what you mean, sure, but that actually makes it better. 

3. **Use imagery if necessary.** Your perception of things is different depending on how you feel. Maybe the sun is shining and birds are singing but all your character pays attention to is the annoying construction sound from the other side of the street. Atmosphere is not decorative, it's information.

4. **Show, don't tell is an exclusive-or**. Don't show *and* tell, because the moment will lose weight completely.

5. **Less is more.** I know how hard this is, because we think writing is always about giving more information, but actually the opposite is true. It's about giving the least amount of information possible to still do the job. This related closely to numbers 2 and 1.Â 

6. **Know when to break the rules**. Show-don't-tell it's a rule about important moments in the story you're telling. It applies to the overall story, and the moments that are key to get the reader to the headspace you need them to be. If something just needs to happen and it's not all that important, tell me it happened. Need emotional weight? Show.

7. **Don't take the first way out of not knowing how to show**. There's many a beaten path for figuring out how to show and not tell, that's what creates tropes. While tropes can be fun, because knowing what will happen can be enjoyable, try not to rely on them too much. Be character specific. Their unique ways of figuring things out will lead them into unique situations. Follow them.

8. **Take your time.** Writing is not a quick hobby. It takes time, effort, and brainpower. After 8h of corporate hell you might not have any that. It's okay. No one says the thing has to be ready in five minutes. Take an year. Take several years. Take a lifetime. It's okay. 

### Why is any of this important?

**When you tell  instead of showing , you're just telling the audience what to think and feel, which guarantees that they won't.** The thing with telling people what to think is that it's *boring*. I tried finding another word for that, but it is what it is, it's boring.

I've been having a hard time reading things, lately. Even published literature has been difficult, because a lot of people are forgetting some of the most basic rules of writing, and at some point it becomes completely unreadable. As a reader we want to reach our own conclusions about something. We want to try to guess what is happening, what the character is feeling, where the whole thing is headed. That's the fun. That's the game. We want to guess things wrong and realize the answer had always been there, staring at us in the face.

The trick is to let things unfold by themselves. As a writer, *you can't interfere*. And I'm not just talking about plot points, or murder mysteries, I'm talking about *people*, too. A connection with a character will never happen if you're telling me exactly what's happening, what they're thinking. I want to get to meet the characters as if I was meeting a new person.

*Let things happen.* Let me make my own choices about what to like, what not to like, what to think about this situation, or this person, or this place. Let me be right about those judgments, and let me be completely wrong about them. 

Let your audience engage their brains and their hearts. That's how they'll connect to your story, to the thing you're trying to say with it.
