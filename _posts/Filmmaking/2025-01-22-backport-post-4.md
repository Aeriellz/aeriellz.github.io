When I started the whole synopsis study thing I was expecting it to be both harder and easier than it was. In reality it’s been something not in the middle, but a more heterogeneous mix of both; a lot of it definitely made worse by the anxiety I have over learning things that are required of me, as opposed to things I _want_ to learn.

The good news is that everything is learnable. The bad news is that how hard it’ll be depends more on your state of mind than your actual skills. Learning is a skill itself, I’m finding as I go through life, an emotional maturity/intelligence kinda thing that you can, and should, develop. It’s the ability to patiently break down things in smaller, bite sized, chunks; to not despair while you go through them slowly. It’s resistance to frustration, to failure.

Which is an absolute imperative when synopsis writing is basically just five hundred iterations of the literal same thing.

Finding that out alone was kind of a lucky strike. I knew what synopsis consisted of, but it seemed too big of a goal to tackle all at once. Too much to think at the same time. Character this, structure that, but what about the scenes? How much do I explain? Is this chunk necessary or kinda just bloat that doesn’t really say much? I only have 500 words, how the _fuck_ am I gonna fit it all in there? It can quickly become overwhelming, and I’m too clinically anxious to deal with overwhelm well.

So I cut it all down and started from something that I know I couldn’t fail at – that’s the best writing advice I've ever received, by the way. Set your first few goals as something you can’t possibly fail at. One sentence a day. Just looking at the page. Or, in my case, just copy-pasting whatever I had developed of this story already from the structure page.

I usually don’t go by the idea that you shouldn't edit while you write, because that makes me go insane with my own mistakes very quickly, but the idea behind it is that you _have to give yourself permission to be bad_. I don’t fear the writing mistakes, but I do fear the structural ones, and that’s where letting it be bad is the most valuable, on the parts of the process you’re the most scared of. So I just made it bad. Sat with it for a day. Realized that it wasn’t going to kill me.

This first version was truly just a copy-paste, I didn’t even make it into full sentences. And then the next day that was my job. Something I couldn’t fail at. Make it readable. Then the next job after that was putting some other key moments in the movie, not caring about how many words it’d end up being, or if it was necessary.

Truth is, I am _not_ super resistant to failure. This shit hurts. So I just lowered the bar into failures I _could_ resist.

Perhaps knowing your limits and how to work with them is also a feature of learning to learn.

The third version forward got me a bit stuck. I had no clue where to go from there. It wasn’t until I went back one more time into all the materials from screenwriting classes past that I found something that could help, and that was the thing that kinda blew the thing open for me.

Again, having a very formulaic, solid, scaffolding saved me from the inside of my mind where nothing is rigid and everything can be anything. The idea for this new version was the following:

### Divide the synopsis in three paragraphs, one for each act. First paragraph deals with everything first act: character presentation, inciting incident, motivations, goals, etc. In the second paragraph we have the first foray into the universe and characters attempting whatever it is they need to attempt, into the midpoint, and the scenes after that. Third paragraph is about the last obstacles and the climax, and the resolution.

Sounds simple, but I swear I didn’t think of it before I saw it explained to me.

That scaffolding got me through the rest of the next few versions, helping me chisel the story from solid rock. Until I finally read what I had around version 7 and realized it was robotic and boring as fuck, and that it was time to get rid of the scaffolding so I could polish things and make it human.

All of the steps were necessary, though, for me to get down to a version I felt confident in. More important than that, it made me more confident in my ability to do it again, to repeat the process and write another synopsis, for an entirely different story, and feel happy with the results. That confidence is what I’ve always been looking for as a writer. The proof that it’s not a fluke, that I could create things without feeling like I’m always doing it in the dark, trying to hit a target I don’t even know the shape of.

I was missing a _method_. I found one for myself, finally, and the relief of having it feels kinda like being able to sit down and rest, knowing you don’t have to reinvent your own wheel all over again when you restart work on the next day. It takes away the weight of anxiety, or fear. It lets me be free to just have fun.

Right now that’s the bar. And I’m trying to stop my habit of raising the bar every time I get close to it. I’m just gonna take a second here, and relax. Enjoy my hard work, and be happy I got where I wanted to go. Next time we’ll talk more about the next steps, yes. But, for now, rest. Appreciation. Joy.
