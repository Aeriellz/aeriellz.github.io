I kinda solved the problem from yesterday? It was a matter of thinking through a scene that had a lot of things happening at once and separating all of it a little bit so I could name everything right. It will return to its mashed up state in the writing of the scene itself, but for structural purposes I had to separate the happenings so I knew exactly what was the purpose of each one in the story.

Now I have another, harder, problem, actually. Even with a formula structured by someone that says "sequence 4 is for establishing X, Y, and Z" you still have to pull said sequence out of your ass. Alas, my ass seems to be out of ideas.

Around a week ago I've met this guy, a screenwriter who wrote for TV and movies usually on assignment, who was struggling with some stuff and said he was blocked. I was a little taken aback. It had been literally a decade, or even more, since I'd last heard those words. I shit you not, before that day I had absolutely forgotten that this is a thing writers talk about.

The forgetting itself is a symptom of a lot of things: of how long it's been since I've been in the presence of other writer, and had a community of people around me that struggled with the same things I did; of how long I've been writing shit that is so fucking boring and devoid of actual creativity that I forgot creativity was something you were supposed to use when writing.

I don't think I even believe in writer's block, anymore. And while I do think that there's virtue in that — it keeps me from waiting for divine inspiration — it also feels like I lost something precious, here, by forgetting about it completely.

There _is_ a sort of aura, as Walter Benjamin would have it, to art. Something about it is precious, and magical, and infused with a sense of fun and mystery. Great things come when you give them time to come, when you open space within yourself by just saying "I don't know". I don't know what to put in this scene. I don't know what to do with this painting. I don't know what to do with this song. The state of not knowing is so beautiful, when you think about it. It jut means that everything is possible, and that things can be built.

I feel like I've been so forced to _do_ thing, so forced to come up with _something_ that everything I come up with sort of looks the same. The original, fun, unhinged, ideas are not there anymore.

Have I industrialized my process of writing so much that I'd been watering down everything that makes this fun for me?

Yeah. Yes, I have. I think I did.

It's a fine balance. Facing your own writing with curiosity everyday, without always wanting to solve the blank page, not forcing it to become something it isn't and watering down it's power, while also not being so scared of shitty ideas that you wait ad infinitum for some perfect solution that's never gonna come.
